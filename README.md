SQL
3. Configuration
Edit src/main/resources/application.properties and update the database connection details:
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/job_scheduler_db
spring.datasource.username=your_postgres_user
spring.datasource.password=your_postgres_password
Use code with caution.
Properties

4. Build and Run
Use the Gradle wrapper to start the application.
./gradlew bootRun
Use code with caution.
Bash
The server will start on http://localhost:8080.
API Documentation & Usage
Full, interactive API documentation is available via Swagger UI once the application is running:
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
Use the Swagger UI or an API client to interact with the endpoints.

    "cronExpression": "0 0 12 ? * MON",
    "jobType": "Email",
    "data": {
